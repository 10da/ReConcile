You die when you stop breathing or when you stop breathing permanently you die. If something is going to die, stop breathing is likely to happen first. Being sick can be the reason why people die means being sick is not likely to happen first as it has happened already before you die. Something is going to die means you stop living, So, stop living is not likely to happen first. When you die you are lifeless, and it is obvious that lifeless bodies don\u2019t move.

The explanation states that you die when you stop breathing permanently, so temporary cessation of breathing is likely to happen first.
