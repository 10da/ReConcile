How much does he pay per year?", "answer_reasoning": "To find out how much John pays per year, we need to determine how many times he gets his grass cut in a year, and then multiply that by the cost. First, we calculate the time it takes for the grass to grow from 2 inches to 4 inches. Since it grows at a rate of 0.5 inches per month, it takes 2/0.5 = 4 months. This means he cuts his grass every 4 months, and therefore gets it cut 12/4 = 3 times a year.
