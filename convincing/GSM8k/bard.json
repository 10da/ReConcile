We know that each drink uses 1 and 1/4 cups of lemonade, so 18 drinks would use 18 * 1 and 1/4 = 25 and 1/2 cups of lemonade. Since each drink also uses 1/4 cup of iced tea, the total amount of iced tea in 18 drinks would be 18 * 1/4 = 4.5 cups. Therefore, the total amount of lemonade and iced tea in the pitcher is 25 and 1/2 + 4.5 = 29 and 1/2 cups.
